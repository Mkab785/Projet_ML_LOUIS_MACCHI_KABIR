# 🚗 Machine Learning Project — Engine Health Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores predictive maintenance for automotive engines using machine learning techniques.

By analyzing engine data such as RPM, temperature, pressure, and other sensor readings, the goal is to anticipate repair needs before failures occur — improving performance, safety, and vehicle longevity.

---

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset includes various features and measurements related to vehicle engine health :
- Engine parameters : RPM, temperature, pressure, etc.  
- Vehicle information : make, model, year, and mileage.

These data enable the development of a predictive maintenance model, capable of identifying patterns that precede mechanical issues.
