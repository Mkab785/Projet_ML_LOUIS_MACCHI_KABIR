About Dataset
The dataset could include various features and measurements related to the engine health of vehicles, such as engine RPM, temperature, pressure, and other sensor data. It may also include metadata on the vehicle, such as make, model, year, and mileage.

Why
This dataset could be used to develop a predictive maintenance model for automotive engines. By analyzing trends, artificial intelligence could anticipate repair needs, helping owners and mechanics to intervene before a breakdown occurs. This would improve the performance and longevity of engines.

Another possible application would be the comparative analysis of the performance of different engines and vehicles. This would allow researchers to evaluate the most effective manufacturers or maintenance strategies that foster innovation in the automotive sector.
